PCI Info text


-> PCI bus is used to connect peripheral devices like graphics card and lan
card to our computer. This bus is connected to CPU processor via south bridge 
and then North Bridge.

-> PCI bus has very good data transfer rate. Data transfer rate of PCIe is 
250 MB per lane up to maximum of 8 GB.

-> PCI has multiple types namely PCI, PCI Express, PCI Extender and Mini PCI.
Clock rate of PCI devices is from 25 Hz to 33 Hz.

-> PCI devices have three address regions:
	1) Configuration Space
	2) Input Output Port
	3) Device Memory.
Configuration space can work on only one slot at a time.

-> Every PCI slot contains 4 interrupt pins. Only one pin can be used at a 
time by CPU.

-> During system boot, firmware of PCI device performs Hardware initialization 
and every region gets connected to different address.
